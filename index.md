### About

**Monday 22th of January** is an educational session around BIDS - it can be attended on it's own if that's just what you are interested in. While being educational, this remains BrainHack, so bring along data to either curate them, or try BIDS apps. The afternoon will have parallel events with either a PET focus or an electrophysiological derivatives focus.

**23rd and 24th** are dedicated to projects, being from the BIDS training session, or anything else you want, in total unconference style. 

--> book your travel and accommodation (i.e. from your own budget); we have secured the hackathon room in a nice hotel and we have the breakfast and lunch covered :-)
